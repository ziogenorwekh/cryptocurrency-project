## Service Flow

### 1. User Service

**1. User Creation (Sign Up) Flow**

- **POST /emails (Email Verification Code Request)**
    - **User Input**: User enters email address for signup and requests verification.
    - **Service Logic**:
        - Validate email format (e.g., `Email.isValidEmailStyle`).
        - Check if the email is already registered (return appropriate error if so).
        - Generate a unique verification code (e.g., 6-digit number).
        - Store the verification code in DB/cache with an expiration time, mapped to the email (e.g., `email`, `code`, `expirationTime`).
        - Send the verification code to the user's email via `EmailService`.
        - Return success response.
- **POST /emails/confirm (Email Verification Code Confirmation)**
    - **User Input**: User enters the email address and verification code received in the previous step.
    - **Service Logic**:
        - Retrieve the stored verification code mapped to the email from DB/cache.
        - Verify if the entered code matches the stored code.
        - Check if the code's validity period has expired (handle error if expired).
        - **On successful verification**: Generate a **temporary token (e.g., JWT)** indicating the email has been verified, and return it to the frontend. This token should have a short validity period and only contain information that the email is verified and registration can proceed (e.g., `{"email": "...", "verified": true}`).
        - **On failed verification**: Return an error like "Verification code does not match or has expired."
- **POST /users (Actual User Creation/Sign Up)**:
    - **User Input**: Email, password, username, etc., entered in the signup form. Include the temporary token received from `POST /emails/confirm` in the request header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <temp_token>`).
    - **Service Logic**:
        - Parse the temporary token from the request header to confirm email verification (check for `verified: true`). If the token is missing or invalid, registration is not allowed.
        - Validate password pattern.
        - Validate username pattern.
        - Create a new `User` entity (using a method like `User.createUser`). The password will be hashed during this process.
        - Save the `User` entity to the database.
        - If immediate login is desired upon successful registration, issue and return a JWT. (Otherwise, simply return a success message).

**2. User Password Reset**

- **POST /users/{userId}/reset/password (Password Reset Request)**
    - **User Input**: Email address of the account for which the password needs to be reset.
    - **Service Logic**:
        - Retrieve the `User` by the provided email. (Verify user existence).
        - Generate a unique `PasswordResetToken` (UUID format).
        - Set an expiration time for the generated token (e.g., 10-30 minutes).
        - Store the token in the database and link it to the `User`.
        - Send an email containing a reset link (including the generated token) to the user's email via `EmailService`.
        - For security, always return a success response (regardless of whether the user exists or not). This prevents exposing whether a specific email is registered in the system.
- **GET /reset-password?token=xxxxxx (Accessing Reset Link, Processing Reset)**
    - **User Input**: None (token included in URL).
    - **Service Logic**:
        - Retrieve `PasswordResetToken` using the received token.
        - **Validate the following conditions**:
            - Token existence
            - Expiration status
            - Whether it has already been used
        - **If valid**: Provide a password reset input form to the frontend (or redirect to the relevant page).
        - **If invalid**: Return an error message or a page indicating "Token is invalid."
- **POST /users/reset-password (Submitting New Password)**
    - **User Input**: `token` (hidden field or query parameter), `newPassword`, `confirmPassword`.
    - **Service Logic**:
        - Retrieve `PasswordResetToken` using the token.
        - **Validate the following conditions**:
            - Token existence
            - Expiration status
            - Whether it has already been used
        - **Validate password**:
            - Whether `newPassword` and `confirmPassword` match.
            - Whether the format is valid according to security rules (length, character combination, etc.).
        - **If valid**:
            - Update the `User`'s password after hashing.
            - Mark the token as consumed (delete or mark as used).
            - Return success response (or redirect to login page).

**3. Transaction History Inquiry**

- **GET /users/{userId}/transactions (Transaction History Inquiry)**
    - **Request**: Includes logged-in `userId`. (Validate `userId` with authentication token).
    - **Service Logic**:
        - Verify that the requested `userId` matches the authenticated user's ID (or if it's an administrator).
        - **Call Trading Service**: Inquire about the trade (order and execution) history for the `userId`. (e.g., `TradingService.getOrdersByUserId(userId)` or `TradingService.getTradeExecutionsByUserId(userId)`).
        - **Call Trading Service or Market Data Service**: Retrieve detailed information (English name, Korean name) for the `itemId`s included in the retrieved transaction history. (e.g., `TradingService.getMarketItemDetails(itemId)` or `MarketDataService.getMarketDataItem(itemId)`).
        - **Data Mapping and Combination**: Map the transaction history data from the Trading Service with the item details to process the necessary information into a structured `List` format.
        - **Return Response**: Return the processed **transaction history List** to the frontend.

**4. 2-Factor Authentication Setup**

- **GET /users/{userId}/security (Current 2-Factor Auth Setting Inquiry)**
    - **Request**: Includes logged-in `userId`.
    - **Service Logic**: Retrieve and return the `User` entity's `SecuritySettings` to show the current 2FA enabled status, configured method, etc. (Client determines current state).
- **PUT /users/{userId}/security/setting (2-Factor Auth Setting Start/Change Request)**:
    - **User Input**: `enable2FA` (enable/disable status), `method` (select from `OTP_APP`, `SMS`, `EMAIL`).
    - **Service Logic**:
        - If `enable2FA` is `false`, immediately disable 2FA and save.
        - If `enable2FA` is `true`, perform the following based on `method`:
            - **OTP_APP**: Generate a new `secret` key and 'temporarily store' or 'mark as pending' in the User's `SecuritySettings`. Return **information needed to generate a QR code (secret, issuer, etc.)** to the frontend. (At this stage, 2FA is not fully activated yet).
            - **SMS or EMAIL**: Send a verification code to the user's contact information (retrieved from DB). Temporarily store the sent code in DB/cache (mapping `userId`, `method`, `code`, `expirationTime`). Return a response to the frontend requesting code input. (Again, 2FA is not active yet).
- **POST /users/{userId}/security/confirm (2-Factor Auth Setting Final Confirmation)**
    - **User Input**: Verification code generated in the previous step (for SMS/Email) or code generated by the OTP app (for OTP app).
    - **Service Logic**:
        - Perform code verification logic based on the `method`:
            - **SMS/EMAIL**: Verify if the code stored in DB/cache matches the input code and has not expired.
            - **OTP_APP**: Use the previously temporarily stored `secret` key and the input code to verify the code's validity with an OTP library.
        - **On successful verification**: Fully update the `User`'s `SecuritySettings` to 'active' status, and finally save the `method` and `secret` (for OTP).
        - **On failed verification**: Return an error.
- **2-Factor Authentication Processing Flow during Login**:
- **POST /login (Initial Login Request)**:
    - **Service Logic**: After validating user ID/password, retrieve the `User`'s `SecuritySettings`.
    - **If 2FA is enabled**:
        - Return a response to the client indicating '2-Factor Authentication Required'. (e.g., `{"status": "2FA_REQUIRED", "method": "SMS"}`)
        - Send a new verification code according to the method (SMS/EMAIL) (call email service, etc.).
        - (For OTP app, no code is sent; the client is prompted to get the code from their OTP app and enter it).
    - **If 2FA is not enabled**: Immediately issue JWT and return a success response.
- **POST /login/2fa (2-Factor Authentication Code Confirmation)**:
    - **User Input**: 2-factor authentication code.
    - **Service Logic**:
        - Identify the user currently attempting to log in via session or a temporary token.
        - Retrieve that user's `SecuritySettings`.
        - Verify if the entered code is valid according to the configured 2FA method (SMS/Email code match, OTP code validity).
        - **On successful verification**: Finally issue JWT and return a success response.
        - **On failed verification**: Return an error.

**5. Profile Image Update**

**5.1 Profile Image Update (PUT /users/{userId}/profile)**

- **User Input**: New `profileImage` (key obtained after client first uploads to bucket).
- **Service Logic**:
    - Verify that the requested `userId` matches the authenticated user's ID (or if it's an administrator).
    - Validate the provided `profileImage` (e.g., whether the key is actually a valid bucket object, whether it's accessible only by a specific user, etc. - if necessary).
    - Retrieve the `User` entity and call a method like `User.updateProfileImage(newProfileImageKey)` to update the profile image key.
    - Save the updated `User` entity to the database.
    - Return success response.
    - **(Optional)**: If an old profile image exists, add logic to delete the previous image file from the bucket to prevent storage waste.
